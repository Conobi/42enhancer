<h1 align=center>42 Session Enhancer</h1>

This project aims to replace your crappy Ubuntu 20.04 session to a beautiful and updated Arch Linux session. No VM, no root needed, works seamlessly on your native session.

For now, it aims to only support **42 Lyon** campus; If you want to add your campus, DM me!
